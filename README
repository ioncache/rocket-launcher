Perhaps slight overkill to use a catalyst application just to control a USB
rocket launcher. However as I was using Catalyst a lot at the time it was
easy to setup.

Minor changes were made to the module Device::USB::MissileLauncher::RocketBaby
to allow passing of a vendor and product id for initialization of the device.
Also, the values for up and down commands were reversed on the device I have so
I changed those as well.

These changes should probably be submitted back to the RocketBaby module on
CPAN, but I wanted to change the module first to allow for multiple profiles
so that different devices will work with it.

Please feel free to make any changes to the code that you wish.

The 'Scratchpad' section of the web interface is just for making notes on test
values.  It isn't saved anywhere, just for use while testing.

Run script/rocket_launcher_server.pl to test the application.
